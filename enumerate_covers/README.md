### Enumerate Covers

To characterize a group, it might be suitable to 
compute its number number of transitive representations onto S(n) upto conjugacy.

When G = \pi_1(X) this amounts to the number of covers of X of index n.

We will use this as in invariant to distinguish the 0-surgeries of further low-crossing knots.

The computation algorithm is natively implemented in Burton's Regina.
