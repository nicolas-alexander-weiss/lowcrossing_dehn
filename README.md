# Low Crossing Knots with K(0,1) = K'(0,1)
Finding two low crossing knots with the same (0,1) Dehn filling is of interests into to find potential candidates
which might serve as counter examples to the 4-dim Poincare Conjecture [insert link to description / paper].

It is of interest to find out what, given all pairs of knots K, K' with distinct (0,1) filling, the minimum
of c(K) + c(K') is. Here c(K) denotes the crossing number of K.

It is known that for K5_2 [correct notation?] an equality of Dehnfillings K5_2(0,1) = K'(0,1) implies K = K'.
Furthermore, an example of two knots with distinct filling was found in [reference!], such that c(K) + c(K') = 26.

Thus, the minimum such sum must lie in the interval [11, 26].

In this repository, we want to determine whether an example of a better pairing can be found between a knot of 
crossing number 16, 17, 18, or 19 and a corresponding knot of crossing number 6, 7, 8 or 9 (respectively).
